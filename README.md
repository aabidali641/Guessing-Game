## Introduction

This project is a Guessing Game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It was developed as part of my internship tasks at InternPay to enhance my programming skills in Java.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the repository*:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/aabidali641/guessing-game-java.git
    

2. *Navigate to the project directory*:
    bash
    cd guessing-game-java
    

3. *Compile the Java files*:

Once the game is running, follow the on-screen prompts to guess the number. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible.
